        The world’s most famous artwork, the Mona Lisa draws thousands of
        visitors to the Louvre Museum each day, many of whom are compelled by
        the sitter’s mysterious gaze and enigmatic smile. The seemingly ordinary
        portrait of a young woman dressed modestly in a thin veil, somber
        colors, and no jewelry might also confound its viewers, who may wonder
        what all the fuss is about. The painting’s simplicity belies Leonardo’s
        talent for realism. The subject’s softly modeled face shows his skillful
        handling of sfumato, an artistic technique that uses subtle gradations
        of light and shadow, rather than line, to model form. The delicately
        painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of
        folded fabric reveal Leonardo’s tireless patience in recreating his
        studied observations. Moreover, the sitter’s perplexing expression only
        adds to her realism. Her smile might be engaging or it might be
        mocking—viewers can’t quite figure it out because, like a human, she is
        a complex figure, embodying contrary characteristics simultaneously.
